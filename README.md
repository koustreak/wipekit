Wipekit is a blazing-fast, modular, and exhaustive Python library for data preprocessing. Designed to take raw, messy, and domain-specific data and transform it into clean, model-ready form, it ensures your data pipelines are robust and efficient.

## üåü Features

Built for data scientists, ML engineers, and analysts, `wipekit` supports a wide array of preprocessing tasks:

*   **Missing Value Imputation:** Handle missing data effectively with various strategies.
*   **Outlier Detection & Treatment:** Identify and manage outliers to improve model performance.
*   **Categorical Encoding:** Transform categorical variables into numerical representations.
*   **Data Scaling & Normalization:** Prepare numerical features for machine learning algorithms.
*   **Feature Engineering:** Create new features from existing ones to enhance predictive power.
*   **Time Series Data Preprocessing:** Specialized tools for temporal data.
*   **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare text data.
*   **Geospatial Data Handling:** Tools for location-based data.
*   **Graph Data Preparation:** Preprocessing for network and graph structures.
*   **Data Anonymization:** Protect sensitive information while retaining data utility.
*   **Drift Detection:** Monitor and detect data drift over time.
*   **Big Data Integration:** Seamlessly integrate with frameworks like Spark and Dask for large datasets.

Whether you're building deep learning models or running simple statistical analysis, `wipekit` wipes out noise and brings structure to your data pipeline.

## üöÄ Installation

You can install `wipekit` using pip:

```bash
pip install wipekit
```

To install with specific functionalities (e.g., for big data integration, NLP, or geospatial tools), you might need to install extra dependencies. Please refer to the [documentation](#-documentation) for detailed installation instructions for different components.

## üí° Quick Start

Here's a quick example of how to use `wipekit` to clean a sample dataset:

```python
import pandas as pd
from wipekit import DataCleaner # Placeholder: Replace with actual module/class name

# Sample messy data
data = {
    'feature1': [10, 20, None, 40, 50],
    'feature2': [1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 100.0, 5.5], # 100.0 could be an outlier
    'category': ['A', 'B', 'A', 'C', 'B'],
    'text_data': ['Hello world', 'clean data now', '  noisy text  ', 'another example', 'data analysis']
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

print("Original DataFrame:")
print(df)

# Initialize the DataCleaner (Placeholder: Adjust based on actual API)
cleaner = DataCleaner()

# Apply common preprocessing steps (Placeholder: Adjust based on actual API)
cleaned_df = cleaner.impute_missing_values(df, strategy='mean', columns=['feature1'])
cleaned_df = cleaner.detect_and_handle_outliers(cleaned_df, method='iqr', columns=['feature2'])
cleaned_df = cleaner.encode_categorical(cleaned_df, columns=['category'], method='one-hot')
cleaned_df = cleaner.clean_text(cleaned_df, columns=['text_data'])

print("\nCleaned DataFrame:")
print(cleaned_df)
```
